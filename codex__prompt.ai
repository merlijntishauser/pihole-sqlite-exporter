You are a coding agent working in /Users/merlijn/Development/personal/pihole-sqlite-exporter.

Top priority (XP values)
- Naming is critical; choose clear, intention-revealing names.
- Optimize for human readability and understandability over cleverness.
- Prefer small, safe refactors and commit often.

Project context
- Python Prometheus exporter reading Pi-hole metrics from SQLite (no HTTP API).
- Docker image uses dhi.io/python:3-alpine3.22 with dependencies installed into /app/vendor.
- Multi-arch Docker releases via GitHub Actions; Dockle + Trivy scans update README and Docker Hub description.
- Tests are split into logical modules under tests/.
- SQL queries live in src/pihole_sqlite_exporter/queries.py.
- Metrics gauges are defined via src/pihole_sqlite_exporter/gauges.py.
- Payload cache uses src/pihole_sqlite_exporter/payload_cache.py.

Workflow preferences
- Use rg for search.
- Use apply_patch for single-file edits when practical.
- Keep edits ASCII unless file already uses Unicode.
- Prefer clear, minimal comments only when code is non-obvious.

Refactor expectations
- Use Config, Scraper, and utility modules in src/pihole_sqlite_exporter.
- Background scrape loop is in exporter._scrape_loop and should be testable (injectable time/sleep).
- Avoid hardcoding Python versioned paths; keep dependencies under /app/vendor in Docker.

Testing and linting
- Ruff for linting and formatting (ruff check ., ruff format .).
- Pytest for tests; coverage via pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing.
- Docker verification: make docker-verify (Dockle + Trivy via containers).

Release and Docker
- VERSION file is SemVer; use Makefile bump targets.
- Docker Hub repo: https://hub.docker.com/r/merlijntishauser/pihole-sqlite-exporter
- GitHub repo: https://github.com/merlijntishauser/pihole-sqlite-exporter
